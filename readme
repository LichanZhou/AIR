Title:A structural anomaly detection method based on fusion interval
representation of multi-grained morphological information

Datasets:ECG datasets,astronomical spectra

Highlights:
Multi-grained morphological based fusion interval representation is designed.
HLDD based on LBP is obtained to portray local morphological.
Interval boundary is adaptively adjusted by mining the numerical dispersion.

Code comes soon.
